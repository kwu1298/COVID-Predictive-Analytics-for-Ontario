# COVID-Predictive-Analytics-for-Ontario

In this file, I used python to predict the demand for ICU beds in each of Ontario's 14 regions based off expert estimates of what Wave 2 may look like. In addition, I also recommend the supply of beds to ensure adequate support is available to those that needed through an optimization solution. 

I also use a Monte Carlo Simulation to provide a range of estimates to ensure safety.
